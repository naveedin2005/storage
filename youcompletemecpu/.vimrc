" NSFileManager defaultManager          That is, no beginning or ending []
" [NSFileManager defaultManager] copyItem       That is, adding a method onto

" 3. List and manipulate project targets as part of being able to build,
" install, run, debug, test, and analyze specific targets under specific
" configurations for specific devices
" 4. Color those things you want colored in Objective-C code
" 5. Color use-defined words (easy-tags ObjC support)
" 6. Improve YouCompleteMe performance.  Disable the gutter? Fork it and make
" it a NeoVim plugin with concurrency?
" - Search only method/function names in project - Use ctags
" - Automate the creation of the -I and -F strings for the YouCompleteMe config file for semantic ObjC completion

"   such as initWithController:userInfo:
" - A command that automatically starts lldb, attaches to the process, and
"   sets a breakpoint on the cursor's current file and line.
" - Create a command that runs the clang static analyzer on the current
"   project
" - Get your vim to look like this: http://brooks.io/syntax-highlight/v2/
"   - indention markers
"   - semantic highilghting
"   - light dark color scheme with muted colors
"   - comment highlight blocks
" - Improve cocoa.vim so it doesn't show { at the end of each method in the ListMethods command
" - Fix documentation search for cocoa.vim
" - Jump to next empty line
" - Search for and jump to the definition of the method under the cursor using
"   ack.  Show results if there is more than one.  Jump to first if there is
"   only one.
" - Delete current method
" - How does vim decide with :set filetype? is?  Why is it set differently for
"   .m and .h files?  objcpp does not seem right for my .h files.
"   Extend the Matchmaker plugin to use ctags so that it only highlights
"   variables, types, or function/method names
"   Put your language-specific settings into ~/.vim/ftplugin/<filestype>.vim
"   Make the vim background stretch the entire background of Terminal.app
" - Ultimately, shouldn't cocoa.vim get constants, etc. from every file that
"   is imported to build the current buffer rather than having a static list
"   of standard library words that will not only change over time, but will
"   also miss some files that are imported but have not been c-tagged.  Two
"   ideas: 1) Use the regexes in cocoa.vim applied to all the headers found in
"   all the Frameworks and includes in the .ycm_extra_conf.py flags. 2) Use
"   ctags on all the headers in all directories in .ycm_extra_conf.py.
"   Improve the yssr behavior so that you can deal with these situations:
"   NSString *myString = NSString stringWithFormat:@"My stuffs"<cursor
